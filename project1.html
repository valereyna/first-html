		<h2>Calculator Using C++</h2>
		<p>This project is a calculator application developed in C++ that utilizes linked list and queue data structures to implement a history feature. The calculator can handle up to 10 or more variables and parameters, and supports a wide range of mathematical operations, including: Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Division, Trigonometry, Square root, Exponent, Logarithm, and Natural Log. The history feature allows users to view and delete previous calculations, making it a useful tool for performing complex mathematical operations and managing calculation history. Overall, this project demonstrates a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, and C++ programming concepts.</p>

		<h2>Weflix Search Engine Using C++</h2>
		<p>This project is a final grou project for Data Structures and Algorithms and it is a movie search engine that utilizes queue, linked list, pointer, and tree functions. To use the search engine, users must first register by creating a unique username and password. Once logged in, users can search for movies based on various criteria, including title, rating, genre, and region. To enhance the user experience, we implemented a search history feature that allows users to view and manage their previous searches. The search engine uses a tree data structure to efficiently store and retrieve movie data, while the queue and linked list functions are used to manage search history and user authentication.</p>

		<h2>Temperature Converter Using Java Netbeans</h2>
		<p>This project is a product of an Object-Oriented Programming course that utilizes Java and the NetBeans IDE to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a temperature converter. The converter is designed to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, providing a simple and user-friendly experience. Through the implementation of Java's Swing library, the GUI features a sleek and intuitive design that allows users to input temperature values and select the desired conversion type. The program then calculates and displays the converted temperature, providing accurate and reliable results.</p>
